1. Create an issue that clearly describes what you're going to do and why. Acceptance criteria should be clearly defined. Every feature issue must link to a user story or requirment.
2. Create a feature branch from that issue.
3. Use that feature branch to make contributions, all commits should be on the form "#n (state of issue) Fix bug on homepage".
4. When all acceptance criteria is fullfilled, make a merge request that removes the current branch and closes the issue in question. A reviewer, that has not made significant contributions to this issue, must be assigned.
