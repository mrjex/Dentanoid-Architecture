## Sprint review 28th Nobember 15:15

- **James**
  * Created endpoints for dentists and patients in the patient API and created a skeleton for the patient client. Will get merged soon.
- **Jonatan**
  * Worked on the endpoints in the patient API, and exception handeling. Pipeline is set up. Issues for tests and data aggregation. 
- **Cornelia**
  * Appointment service, HTTPS status codes and exception handeling
- **Joel - not participating** 
- **Mohamad**
  * Go tests for the endpoints, made tests for the dentist CRUD. Lightly documenting the endpoints. 
- **Lucas**
  * Patient endpoints refactored so that they are concurrent (lucas think they are concurrent), some error handeling done and MQTT messaging. 

### Discussion

* Needs some standardized MQTT document, jonatan takes it upon hisself to create this document.

## Sprint retrospective 28th 16:00

- **What Went Well?** 
  * No bigger issues with assigned tasks per say. Team work between james and jonatan was seamless this weak, they like being a scrum of scrums (according to james). 
- **What Can We Improve?** 
  * Some times issues are not written out directly, but added when needed. It would be nice to have all the issues from the start. Sprints inherintly feels short, but this sprint felt extra short. It is hard to follow each others workflow, and some times members jump between different tasks.
- **How Should We Improve Until Next Sprint?** 
  * Work more with planning all the issues 
  * We will not delay the planning or review anytime again
