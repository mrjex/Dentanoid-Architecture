## Discussion

**A go version of the appointmentservice have been created.** The java version have been experienced as to complex and carries some errors that are hard to debug. The group will decide on wether to keep the java version or use the newer go version. 

There are pros and cons for both versions, the java version is more complex while the go version is more light weight. However, we are unsure about fixing the errors in Java. The lighter Go version will get used from this day **5th December,** but the java version will still be preserved in the repo. 

Mohamad suggests working on the docker to deploy services.
